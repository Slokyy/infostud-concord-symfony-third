# Symfony car rent application

This is a basic car rent app made using Symfony Framework.

## Setup ðŸ“ƒ

Below we will setup the symfony project

## Get the project

### First we need to get the project from this git

Open your designated terminal and go to your www, htdocs, html ... etc folder and run the below command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slokyy/symfony-car-rent.git
```

## Installing dependencies

### Installing the needed dependencies for the project

After running the clone you need to move into the newly pulled project
Once inside run these basic commands to install needed dependencies

Install symfony dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

## Setting the database

### .env setup

Go into .env file on the line where mysql is configured and enter needed info to connect to your local database.
Swap _db_user_ with _database user_, _db_password_ with _database password_ and _db_name_ with _database name_. Make sure the db_name is unique and non existant inside mysql.

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL="mysql://db_user:db_password@127.0.0.1:3306/db_name?serverVersion=5.7&charset=utf8mb4"
```

### Running doctrine commands that create the database

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you have your local webserver running at this point

Run below commands to create the database:

```bash
symfony console doctrine:database:create
```

After this verify that the database is created in your mysql database environment

### Next we need to run the migrations

**Sanity Check:** Check the migrations folder and if for some reason its missing Version files you will need to run:

```bash
symfony console make:migration
```

Run this command only if the above notice is true and you don't have the migration files.
If you have the migration files run:

```bash
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

After this you should check your database and confirm that you have sucessfully migrated.
You should see 5 tables, doctrines doctrine_migration_versions and messenger_messages and most importantly: users, clients and user_client tables

These tables should have their structure setup.

### Optional: Setting up data

If you want you can grab the dummy files you can find it in _symfony_third_task.sql_ file at the base of the project.

This file contains the whole database structure and some dummy data.

### If you did not do the above option

While you are here it would be wise to enter an admin user here so you can log into the app.
Admin is a user with the role of: ["ROLE_ADMIN"].

## Starting the project

To start the project you need to run two commands (symfony server and yarn watcher for webpack)

### Symfony server

```bash
symfony serve -d
```

This should run the server on localhost:8000 by default, if the port is in use it will tell you

If the port is somewhere else or unknown just find it by running:

```bash
symfony console server:list
```

## THATS IT, ENJOY ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

# DISCLAIMER âš¡âš¡âš¡

This is a project that I made while learning symfony, please contact me if you see some problems, bad practices etc.
I'm still learning and I would appreciate your help in getting my skills to the next level.
